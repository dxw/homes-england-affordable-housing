# 13. use-auth0-for-authentication

Date: 2020-11-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application needs a mechanism for authenticating users.

## Decision

Use Auth0 for user authentication. This is the application most often used by
dxw, and is also recommended by Homes England's digital team.

## Consequences

Administrators of the application at Homes England will have to create user
accounts for application users. Application users will need to go through the
process of choosing a new password and having to remember that password.
